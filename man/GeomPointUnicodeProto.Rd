\title{Geom to point unicode as shapes}
\format{
An object of class \code{GeomPointUnicodeProto} (inherits from \code{GeomPoint}, \code{Geom}, \code{ggproto}, \code{gg}) of length 4.
}
\usage{
GeomPointUnicodeProto
}
\description{
Define a Geom using \code{ggplot2::ggproto()} and based on GeomPoint.
The Geom internally uses \code{textGrob} instead of \code{pointsGrob} so that fonts leverage for drawing shapes.
Custom ggproto for Unicode Point Shapes

A custom ggproto object that extends GeomPoint to use Unicode characters
as plot symbols instead of standard R plotting symbols. This allows for more diverse
and visually appealing point shapes in ggplot2 graphics.
}
\details{
This geom uses Unicode characters to render points, providing access to
a wider variety of shapes than standard R plotting symbols. The shapes are rendered
as text using grid::textGrob, which allows for better scaling and appearance.

Key features:
\itemize{
\item Uses Unicode characters for point rendering
\item Supports color, fill, size, and alpha aesthetics
\item Default shape is a filled square (\\u2588)
\item Compatible with all standard ggplot2 aesthetics and scales
}
}
\section{Shape Validation}{

Shape codes are validated to ensure they are valid Unicode points. Invalid
codes will fall back to default shapes or generate warnings.

The \code{grid} and \code{scales} packages are supposed to be required by \code{ggplot2}.
So there should not be any issue as installing \code{ggplot2} should install those 2 packages.
